explaination
That's a loop that says, okay, for every time that i is smaller than and equals to 10,
I'm going to do whatever is in the code block. Whenever i reaches 10, I'll stop.
After each iteration of the loop, it increments i by 1 (i++),
so that the loop will eventually stop when it meets the i <= 10 (i becomes 11, so no longer is smaller than) condition.
